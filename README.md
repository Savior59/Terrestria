# Terrestria
It is the 25th century, the fleet began as a single effort for humanity to band together after the recent Sol War devastated humanities home system. Only 7 planets remain as Mercury was pushed into the Sun. Somewhere between the stars, factions formed on the ships and the collective mission dissolved. Political extremism spread like wildfire and many ships opened fire on one another. The only surviving ships are those that are not within range of each other. These ships raced towards the same system, societies redeveloping in completed isolation decade after decade. The only contact with another ship were salvage missions sent to the shattered hulls of nearby ships that had melted open from your microwave beam, once used to communicate with Sol, now a weapon of war. The time has come now, nearly a century later, for war. Build up planetary infrastructure, form alliances, and wage war with other colonies.
